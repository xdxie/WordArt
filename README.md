# Toward Understanding WordArt: Corner-Guided Transformer for Scene Text Recognition （ECCV 2022 Oral）
The official code of CornerTransformer (ECCV 2022, Oral).

This work focuses on a new challenging task of **artistic text recognition**. To tackle the difficulties of this task, we introduce the corner point map as a robust representation for the artistic text image and present the corner-query cross-attention mechanism to make the model achieve more accurate attention. We also design a character contrastive loss to learn the invariant features of characters, leading to tight clustering of features. In order to benchmark the performance of different models, we provide the WordArt dataset.

## Runtime Environment
This repo depends on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [MMCV](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv), [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection) and [MMOCR](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr).
Below are quick steps for installation.
Please refer to [MMOCR Install Guide](https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for more detailed instruction.

```shell
conda create -n wordart python=3.7 -y
conda activate wordart
conda install pytorch==1.10 torchvision cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
pip install mmcv-full -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu113/torch1.10.0/index.html
pip install mmdet
git clone https://github.com/xdxie/WordArt.git
cd WordArt
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -v -e .
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd):$PYTHONPATH
pip install -r requirements/albu.txt
```

## Training
For distributed training on multiple GPUs, please use
```shell
./tools/dist_train.sh ${CONFIG_FILE} ${WORK_DIR} ${GPU_NUM} [PY_ARGS]
```
For training on a single GPU, please use
```shell
python tools/train.py ${CONFIG_FILE} [ARGS]
```
For example, we use this script to train the model:
```shell
./tools/dist_train.sh configs/textrecog/corner_transformer/corner_transformer_academic.py outputs/corner_transformer/ 4
```

## Evaluation
For distributed evaluating on multiple GPUs, please use
```shell
./tools/dist_test.sh ${CONFIG_FILE} ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} ${GPU_NUM} [PY_ARGS]
```
For evaluating on a single GPU, please use
```shell
python tools/test.py ${CONFIG_FILE} ${CHECKPOINT_FILE} [ARGS]
```
For example, we use this script to evaluate the model performance:
```shell
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python tools/test.py outputs/corner_transformer/corner_transformer_academic.py outputs/corner_transformer/latest.pth --eval acc
```

## WordArt Dataset
The WordArt dataset consists of 6316 artistic text images with 4805 training images and 1511 testing images.  The dataset is available at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SanxRwTxd2q7UrQxlbC3BmP3nhFXwZ3g/view?usp=sharing).

## Results
|Model|IC13|SVT|IIIT|IC15|SVTP|CUTE|WordArt|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|CornerTransformer|96.4|94.6|95.9|86.3|91.5|92.0|70.8|

## Visualization
Each example is along with the results from ABINet-LV, our baseline and the proposed CornerTransformer. Hard examples are successfully recognized by CornerTransformer.

When decorative patterns from the background have exactly the same appearance and similar shape as the texts, CornerTransformer may fail to achieve correct results. These are indeed challenging examples for any text recognizer. Each image is along with our result and the ground truth.
